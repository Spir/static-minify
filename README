======================================
Static-Minify

Add a CodeIgniter minify controller to 
handle your static content 

This script is using Minify

Minify is a PHP5 app that helps you follow several of Yahoo!'s Rules for High Performance Web Sites.

Currently using Minify 2.1.3


======================================
Installation

1. copy and paste the files : 

Copy and paste config/minify.php to your config directory
Copy and paste controllers/min.php to your controller directory (could be in module if you are using CodeIgniter MX).

Note: you could rename min to whatever you wanted.


2. Set the proper route to handle your static content.

In your config/route.php :

$route['js/(:any)'] = "min/$1";
$route['css/(:any)'] = "min/$1";

3. configure the static-minify config

Open config/minify.php and change the settings to your convenience.

======================================
Improvements

This piece of code could be really improved and is a working draft.
For instance call the propper minify script depending on the file type.
For now I let Minify doing this job.
Also some more config could be set if users want to minify static html, json or some other static content.
One could edit controller/config for that purpose.
